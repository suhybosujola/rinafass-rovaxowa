Overview
Find freedom from anxiety as you lift your gaze from the problems and pressures of this world to the changeless and powerful character of your heavenly Father. Is my cancer back? Is my job secure? Will I ever get married? Are my children safe? Our lives are often a chronicle of trouble, pain, and uncertaintyâ€”and God&#039;s children yearn for peace. Many who wrestle with anxiety and despair know that the Bible calls them to &quot;trust God,&quot; but what does that even mean? In Consider the Lilies, pastor, podcaster, and speaker Jonny Ardavanis shows us God&#039;s consistent response to those who are worn down by worry and badgered by melancholy: He proclaims His own character. Drawing on that perspective-shifting model, Jonny offers biblical insight on how to ground our thoughts and fix our gaze on who God is. Compassionate, biblical, and timely, Consider the Lilies explores: How dwelling on the character of God is the surest pathway to peace The root causes of anxiety and worry in the Bible What the Bible says about the integration of our physical and spiritual lives Why worry grieves God&#039;s heart as our Father Consider the Lilies is for those who long for liberation from their anxiety and fearâ€”and desire to deeply know the God they are called and enabled to trust. If you are starved for hope and gasping for peace, consider the character of your heavenly Father, who welcomes all who are anxious, fearful, and melancholy to trust in Him.
