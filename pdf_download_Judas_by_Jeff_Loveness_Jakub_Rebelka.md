Overview
Judas by Jeff Loveness, Jakub Rebelka Judas Iscariot journeys through life and death, grappling with his place in “The Greatest Story Ever Told.”

 EVERY STORY NEEDS A VILLAIN

 Judas Iscariot is one of the most tragic figures of the Bible — an acolyte, a betrayer, a villain. But if it wasn’t for Judas... the story of Jesus wouldn’t work. Before he was born, he was a slave to the story. In a religion built on redemption and forgiveness, one man had to sacrifice himself for everyone... and it wasn’t Jesus.

 Written by Emmy and WGA Award-nominated Jeff Loveness (Nova) and illustrated by Jakub Rebelka (Namesake), Judas is a visually striking odyssey of spirituality and fantasy that follows Judas Iscariot through the depths of Hell as he grapples with his place in the “Greatest Story Ever Told,” facing trials and tribulations taken from between the lines of the Bible.
