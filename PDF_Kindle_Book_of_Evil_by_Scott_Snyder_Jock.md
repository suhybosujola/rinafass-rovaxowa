Blending prose and multiple kinds of illustration, New York Times-bestselling comics writer Scott Snyder (We Have Demons) and renowned comics artist Jock (Batman, Wytches) weave a tale of horror about growing up in a world far more harrowing than our own.
 
 Imagine that from tomorrow morning onward, nearly every baby born into this world is a future psychopath.
 
 There is no answer as to why the change is happening. Is this human evolution? Devolution? An uncurable virus of some kind? Regardless, just like that, the new normal is psychopathy.
 
 Fifty years in the future, four friends must set off on a journey that will take them down the roads and rivers of this transformed America in hope of finding a place where goodness still lives.
