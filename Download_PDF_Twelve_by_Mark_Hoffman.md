Overview
TWELVE
 Twelve is a story of any and all power corrupting absolutely, and religious power, the most pernicious and dissolute. It is the late 1950s, and Declan Becket is a freshly minted Jesuit priest who suddenly and surprisingly is appointed the priest for a small, neglected parish in northern Washington. Soon after arriving, he is approached by two mothers who accuse two former parish priests of sexually abusing their sons. Their efforts to find justice for themselves and their sons have fallen &quot;among the thorns,&quot; choked to silence. Becket is mindful of the evil men can commit. He fought and was wounded in Italy in World War II, discovered Italian concentration camps, and investigated and prosecuted war crimes. As Becket doggedly peels back the layers of an expanding number of accusations, he exposes a fraternity of cruelty, silence, and conspiracy, a depraved fellowship.
