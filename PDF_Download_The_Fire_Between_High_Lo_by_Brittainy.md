Logan is haunted by a darkness that should scare her, not thrill her. It should push her away, not bring her closer. And above all, it should warn her to close her heart against the crash that will inevitably shatter them bothâ€¦Â  &amp;quot;VIVID AND BEAUTIFULLY EMOTIONAL.&amp;quot; â€“ELLE KENNEDY, NYT BESTSELLING AUTHOR There once was a boy, and I loved him. Logan Francis Silverstone and I were complete opposites. I danced, and he stood still. He was quiet, while I ran my mouth. He struggled to find a smile, and I refused to frown. The night I saw the darkness that truly lived inside of him, I couldn&amp;#039;t look away. We were broken together, yet somehow whole. We were wrong together, but always right. We were the stars that burned across the night sky, searching for a wish, praying for better tomorrows. Until the day I lost him. He threw us away with one hasty decisionâ€”a decision that changed us forever. There once was a boy, and I loved him. And for a few breaths, a few whispers, a few moments, I think he loved me, too. Consistently topping BOOKTOK&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;Books That Make You Ugly Cry&amp;quot; lists, The Fire Between High &amp;amp; Lo brings the angst, the spice, and the beautifully painful longingâ€¦ THE ELEMENTS SERIES: The Air He Breathes, book 1 The Fire Between High &amp;amp; Lo, book 2 The Silent Waters, book 3 The Gravity of Us, book 4
