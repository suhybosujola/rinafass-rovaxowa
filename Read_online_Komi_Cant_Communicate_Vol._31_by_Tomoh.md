The journey to 100 friends begins with a single conversation.
 
 Socially anxious high school student Shoko Komiâ€™s greatest dream is to make some friends, but everyone at school mistakes her crippling social anxiety for cool reserve. Luckily she meets Tadano, a timid wallflower who decides to step out of his comfort zone in order to help her achieve her goal of making 100 friends.
 
 Tadano and Komi are going to the summer festival together! Itâ€™s a classic date destination, almost a rite of passage for couples. But rites of passage come with high expectations and high pressureâ€”especially when it seems like the whole world is out to ruin your night! Can Tadano and Komi save their date from bad luck and worse weather?
