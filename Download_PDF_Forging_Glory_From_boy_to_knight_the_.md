Born the twelfth son of a minor lord, Roger knew from an early age that he would have to earn his place in a world of battle, politics, and honor. Most of his brothers have already left for far-off lands to earn their own fame and fortune. With war fomenting in Normandy, Roger finds his opportunity defending the land he grew up in. His family relies on him to preserve their legacy. The woman he loves will accept nothing less than his best. Does Roger have what it takes to forge a life worth living, or will he fade into commonality?
