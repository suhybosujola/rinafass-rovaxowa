Overview
After experiencing marginal success as Korean pop idols but also continual mistreatment and zero compensation for their efforts, Hana and her groupmate Caitlin have had enough. They enact a startling plan to bring the fortunes of their group Halcyon crashing down, but the agency response is swift, forcing the team into a hiatus and pushing the girls&#039; physical and mental health to breaking point. Can Hana and Caitlin successfully burn down everything that they have worked so hard to build, without also throwing their own futures into the flames? THE LOVE COMPLETE is the fourth and final novel in the Shin Hana series from controversial Korean pop writer KPOPALYPSE, and the story picks up from exactly where the third book LOVE CAROUSEL left off. This book is completely fictional. You can trust us.
