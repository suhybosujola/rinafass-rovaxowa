 For generations, the solar system â€” Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt â€” was humanity&#039;s great frontier. Until now. The alien artifact working through its program under the clouds of Venus has appeared in Uranus&#039;s orbit, where it has built a massive gate that leads to a starless dark.
 
 Jim Holden and the crew of the Rocinante are part of a vast flotilla of scientific and military ships going out to examine the artifact. But behind the scenes, a complex plot is unfolding, with the destruction of Holden at its core. As the emissaries of the human race try to find whether the gate is an opportunity or a threat, the greatest danger is the one they brought with them.
 
 Abaddon&#039;s Gate is a breakneck science fiction adventure following the critically acclaimed Caliban&#039;s War.
